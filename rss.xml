            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Here&apos;s the best reason of all to drink organic wine: It tastes better.</h1><p>Do organic wines taste better than conventional wines? Conventional wisdom would say no. We may shop at Whole Foods Market or MOM&apos;s Organic Market, and we may pull over in traffic at the sight of a farmer with a load of tomatoes on a flatbed truck, but apparently we raise a skeptical eyebrow at the word &quot;organic&quot; on a wine label.</p><img src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/12/Food/Images/2015-02-10T175236Z_01_DUV486_RTRIDSP_3_FRANCE-ALCOHOL-EXPORTS.jpg"></article>]]></description>

In fact, before Prohibition, it was not unusual in the U.S. to find refillable wooden kegs at bars and even in retail shops .

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>You Think You Know Malbec Wine. You Are Wrong.</h1><p>First, a confession. I&apos;ve long thought malbecs from Argentina vastly overrated, slack-jawed big reds found hanging out in bad steakhouses and touted as $15 retail bargains. So when a host of new, elite versions costing more than $100 a bottle recently came on the scene I didn&apos;t expect to be won over.</p><img src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iB4Yo_xH7wDo/v0/-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Beers With the Most (and Least) Calories</h1><p>Source: ThinkstockAmericans have always loved their beer. When the Pilgrims set out for the New World nearly 400 years ago, the hold of their ship, the Mayflower, was filled with barrels of beer. Even during Prohibition in the 1920&apos;s and early 1930&apos;s, America&apos;s thirst for alcohol remained strong, funding bootlegging businesses and criminal organizations.</p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/247wallst.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/bucket-of-beer.jpg?fit=440%2C330&ssl=1"></article>]]></description>

But it&apos;s also the granddaddy of summer cocktails, keeping drinkers cool in the heat since the late 18th century, when early-rising Virginia farmers took to downing them in the morning.</p><img src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i_m7LlhQqWeo/v0/-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
