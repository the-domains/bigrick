With a history stretching back to the 1870s, the state has been playing with this high-profile grape for well over a century, although it wasn't until the 1970s that Californian Cabernet really gained global acclaim.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5ee72e0fb9db4362af2496f0af2d53cc484a4b7f.png"></article>]]></description>
