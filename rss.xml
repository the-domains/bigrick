            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The 25 Best Rosés Under $25</h1><p>Brace yourself. Rosé season starts this weekend. The drink pink boom means pale and pretty wines will be poured at patio parties everywhere to jumpstart a hopefully decadent summer lifestyle.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Napa vintner Donn Chappellet dies at 84</h1><p>The Chronicle has learned that Donn Chappellet, founder of Napa Valley's Chappellet winery, died on Sunday at home with his family. He was 84. Not only did Chappellet and his family create one of Napa's most iconic Cabernet brands, but they also - in a slightly unusual move - trademarked Pritchard Hill, the subregion in which their property lies, and never allowed it to become an official American Viticultural Area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2d0b63aa736b1af42e85193471c9e05849171db5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
