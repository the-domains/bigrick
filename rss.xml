            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mendoza the home of Malbec</h1><p>Driving down a dirt road in Luyan de Cuyo, Mendoza, an hour and a half late for our appointment, I'm still making sense of the traffic ticket I just received. Additionally, there is no signage for the wine estate we are visiting. Nor cell phone service. And the car is without GPS.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/42baa0510708d4efc82840156a1c54e32e0c1c2c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It wouldn't be a surprise to say that there is lots of great food there, and I still appreciated much of it even after having multiple lunches and dinners on the same day.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2d5e99e267a80e21467cb59cc1339bfa055d7b13.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Millennials drink more wine, post about it on Facebook - PALATE PRESS</h1><p>Don't think that presidential politics is the only game of "who do you love?" now being played out. Just as pollsters have been surveying voter preferences in places as diverse as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, researchers hired by the Wine Market Council (WMC) have been surveying adult Americans about whether they drink wine, how much wine they drink if they do and what kind of wine will they purchase when they go into a wine store or restaurant.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ee5c8e84ef7b3c666df073cd730c32797a290ffc.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cheap wine: What do I expect?</h1><p>A visitor left a comment the other day in the first $3 wine challenge post: "Hey, it cost less than $3. So what did you expect?" Hence this post, because even though a cheap wine doesn't cost much, that doesn't mean it has to taste cheap: * Varietal correctness.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8a2c41f87a3f81711e2b36600bb95b062bc7faf1.png"></article>]]></description>
