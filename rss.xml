And that, according to a recent interview, his Catholic faith helped him through one of the darkest times of his life.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/314ad5bdb8c717c3b975dc1c8bf3fc2528283e90.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Now we can debate the finer distinctions between a score of 875 and 876. Or 943 and 944. Or 563 and 562. Whaaat?? That's right. There's a new wine rating kid in town, called Wine Lister, and it uses, not the familiar 100-point system, but a thousand point system.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bf885c95d25d2da2c8171b6caf97e2a125de267c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
