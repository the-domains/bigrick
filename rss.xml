            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ask a Somm: When Should I Decant Wine?</h1><p>Back before the days of Roy Choi and Michael Voltaggio, Los Angeles was home to chefs like Wolfgang Puck, Nancy Silverton, and Josiah Citrin - the city's old guard. Perhaps retaining some of L.A.'s original DNA, those latter chefs have mostly stayed true to proper white tablecloth dining, a nearly extinct species among the city's influx of fermentation and bowls of raw fish.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e617ffa551f5cfe87751e5361579070400c85353.jpg"></article>]]></description>
