These 10 Beers Are for You</h1><p>Broadly speaking, what beer fans call a "session beer" is one that should wield a low enough alcohol content that, if consumed in succession during one sit-down "session" of drinking, one doesn't get too inebriated. Now, the specific line of demarcation in alcohol by volume (ABV) that constitutes a session beer is subjective.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f4c1f62d2d86a396326512b26d77ad07/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.bwbx.io%2Fimages%2Fusers%2FiqjWHBFdfxIU%2FiIgAizvCas6s%2Fv0%2F-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
