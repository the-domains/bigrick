            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Seasoned winemakers launch new valley brand</h1><p>Doug Shafer and Elias Fernandez aren't winemakers who dwell on the past. They could, however, considering the success they've achieved in a three-decade-plus association at Shafer Vineyards that has consistently produced some of the area's best wines, ranging from remarkable Red Shoulder Ranch chardonnay to the Hillside Select cabernet sauvignon from the estate vineyard in the Stags Leap District.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9f5e609567dfc5dbb61bfc964f08f6083f965ce9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Connoisseurs' Guide to California Wine</h1><p>By Stephen Eliot One of the steady refrains in wine commentary these days is the call for a return to more "honest" times. Wine, we are told is losing its cultural relevance and soul as science, technology and technique have spawned what amounts to a hostile take-over of the winemaking craft, and "manipulation" has become tantamount to an unforgiveable sin.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Napa vintner Donn Chappellet dies at 84</h1><p>The Chronicle has learned that Donn Chappellet, founder of Napa Valley's Chappellet winery, died on Sunday at home with his family. He was 84. Not only did Chappellet and his family create one of Napa's most iconic Cabernet brands, but they also - in a slightly unusual move - trademarked Pritchard Hill, the subregion in which their property lies, and never allowed it to become an official American Viticultural Area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2d0b63aa736b1af42e85193471c9e05849171db5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
