Bring us some fresh wine, the freshest you've got!"</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/65ebdc8497b8f1bb0cbbb90e75fa4cbf94bc0ee6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Five decades of Napa Valley wines: How long can they age?</h1><p>One knock against wines made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes in Napa Valley, California is that they don't age as well as most of their Old World counterparts, particularly those from France. The trouble with that criticism is that it firstly assumes Napa Valley winemakers want to make wines that can age for decades, and secondly, that older wines are better than younger wines and thus more valuable.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7c99cb39dfa453a674ecdcbe33120b0dbe7b7281.jpg"></article>]]></description>
