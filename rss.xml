            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Kobe Bryant's Catholic Faith Pulled Him Through His Darkest Hour | ChurchPOP</h1><p>If for some reason you don't know who Kobe Bryant is, he's only one of the best basketball players ever. And he recently retired from the NBA. What most people don't know, though, is that he's Catholic. And that, according to a recent interview, his Catholic faith helped him through one of the darkest times of his life.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/314ad5bdb8c717c3b975dc1c8bf3fc2528283e90.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Another wine-rating system, this time based on 1,000 points</h1><p>Forget about arguing over the differences between 96 and 97 points. Now we can debate the finer distinctions between a score of 875 and 876. Or 943 and 944. Or 563 and 562. Whaaat?? That's right. There's a new wine rating kid in town, called Wine Lister, and it uses, not the familiar 100-point system, but a thousand point system.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bf885c95d25d2da2c8171b6caf97e2a125de267c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
