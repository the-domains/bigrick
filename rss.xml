            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2013 Kirkland Signature Series Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon - CostcoWineBlog.com</h1><p>Here's another Kirkland wine that I've been anxiously awaiting - the 2013 Signature Series Napa Cab. I really enjoyed the 2012 vintage of this wine, which was a fantastic growing year, and 2013 was according to some accounts, almost equally as good.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9c33b69beeb3eaf294f291bf026ef8a01fcb5249.jpg"></article>]]></description>

But its a little more interesting when Conde Nast Traveler readers pin Healdsburg (12), Napa(8) and San Francisco (9) among the 15 Best Food Cities in the U.S.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6381c21dc91289873bfe55a0a91e83beb58b0602.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Wines of Mount Veeder Tasting: April 21, San Francisco</h1><p>The Wines of Mount Veeder Tasting: April 21, San Francisco. Many people have visited Napa Valley, in some cases many times, without setting food on some of its most interesting terroir. That's because the steep and remote hillsides of Napa's mountain AVAs tend to be sparsely populated and accessible only by carsick-inducing roads that most tour buses, limos, and unadventurous tourists can't manage.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/387d0edee9cc0e7012faca2dc65d4224e2e944cb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
