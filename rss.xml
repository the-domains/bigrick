            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>On that Prisoner deal: Brands without land? I don't think so</h1><p>On the Sales road today in the midst of a busy week, but first I want to comment on the headline this morning that Constellation has purchased The Prisoner for $285 million. I "get it" that some of these big wine companies are going after these mass brands, like Meiomi, which was scooped up by Constellation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d6b5cfa9afbf8fad6f86618c875210808ea18354.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Gourmet Wine Experiences in Napa</h1><p>Some of the best food and wine in Napa can't be found at restaurants, but at wineries.

Some programs offer a meal while others serve simple bites to accompany a flight of wines, but either way, it makes for a very memorable wine country experience.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2ba7abac6d863edfeb72b2aa4805afcf5665a8a1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>From Minnesota to California, another winemaker finds success</h1><p>"The average aging of a wine takes place in the back seat of the car on the way home." That's one of my favorite wine aphorisms. Minnesota native Jeff Runquist clearly follows that philosophy. At his winery of the same name in California's Amador County, Runquist crafts what he aptly calls "youthful, zesty wine that is at its peak when it goes in the bottle.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/adbc024d53e8b3b29b41238fe8ee8954b1408814.jpg"></article>]]></description>
