            <title><![CDATA[Five decades of Napa Valley wines: How long can they age?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Five decades of Napa Valley wines: How long can they age?</h1><p>One knock against wines made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes in Napa Valley, California is that they don't age as well as most of their Old World counterparts, particularly those from France. The trouble with that criticism is that it firstly assumes Napa Valley winemakers want to make wines that can age for decades, and secondly, that older wines are better than younger wines and thus more valuable.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7c99cb39dfa453a674ecdcbe33120b0dbe7b7281.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Do you think it's still good? | Ask Dr. Vinny | Wine Spectator</h1><p>I wanted to gift a wine to a boss who is a wine connoisseur, and I thought I found a great one: Caymus Cabernet Special Selection 1990. I paid a pretty penny for it, but now I'm worried that maybe it's past its prime. What do you think? -Maureen U., Stockton, Calif.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f27faa9bb576cae2b16ab5b9e0d99afc0679c3c0.gif"></article>]]></description>
