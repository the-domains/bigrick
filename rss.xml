            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Walla Walla - early, hot but good</h1><p>Like many wine regions around the world, Walla Walla in Washington state had its earliest harvest on record in 2015. Even so, producers throughout the Valley are happy with wine quality and most especially with the region's three most-planted varieties: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b2c0911b086ba9f8bc2e9d402e5729eeccb83263.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Terroir is a Myth - Fermentation</h1><p>The idea that "Terroir" is the source of fine wine flavor is a myth. This is according to Professor Mark Matthews at the University of California, Davis in his new and controversial book: "Terroir and Other Myths of Winemaking." As the title of this new book implies, the myth of terroir is only part of Matthews' investigation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8748fc4e4fd62ba273e920f66772c9da1c60aa91.jpg"></article>]]></description>

I don't think so</h1><p>On the Sales road today in the midst of a busy week, but first I want to comment on the headline this morning that Constellation has purchased The Prisoner for $285 million.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Gourmet Wine Experiences in Napa</h1><p>Some of the best food and wine in Napa can't be found at restaurants, but at wineries. You'll have to reserve ahead, but these splurge-worthy tours offer gastronomic experiences that go far beyond the swirl, sip, and spit routine you'll find at most tasting rooms. Some programs offer a meal while others serve simple bites to accompany a flight of wines, but either way, it makes for a very memorable wine country experience.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2ba7abac6d863edfeb72b2aa4805afcf5665a8a1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>From Minnesota to California, another winemaker finds success</h1><p>"The average aging of a wine takes place in the back seat of the car on the way home." That's one of my favorite wine aphorisms. Minnesota native Jeff Runquist clearly follows that philosophy. At his winery of the same name in California's Amador County, Runquist crafts what he aptly calls "youthful, zesty wine that is at its peak when it goes in the bottle.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/adbc024d53e8b3b29b41238fe8ee8954b1408814.jpg"></article>]]></description>
