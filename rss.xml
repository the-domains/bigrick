            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Pinot Noir 4.0: An exploration of extreme terroir in California and Oregon</h1><p>This is my take on the situation. I hope to hear from you about yours. Agree, disagree, whatever you add will be appreciated. Thanks. * * * Pinot 1.0 extended from approximately the Repeal of Prohibition (1933) through the 1950s. Growers knew they wanted to plant Pinot Noir because it was the great grape of Burgundy.</p></article>]]></description>
