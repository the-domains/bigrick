            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2016 Is the Year for New World Wines: What to Buy</h1><p>In every wine country, vintners anxiously scan the skies all year, hoping weather challenges will still let them make great, or at least good, wine. So far, 2016 has been a very rough year for Europe's vintners, with one weather catastrophe after another. Hailstorms in Barolo.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6289ee6563bab78172e02c4b5c41ed5a/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.bwbx.io%2Fimages%2Fusers%2FiqjWHBFdfxIU%2Fig..39Thjalc%2Fv0%2F-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>California eradicates the European grapevine moth</h1><p>In what's being heralded a "success story," California is officially eradicated of the European grapevine moth (EGVM). The good news means the lifting of quarantine restrictions in several grape-growing regions throughout the state. The EGVM was first detected in a Napa County Chardonnay vineyard in 2009, the first time ever the pest was discovered in North America.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/87286c50adc41552a7c0279d35d3ca40/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwesternfarmpress.com%2Fsite-files%2Fwesternfarmpress.com%2Ffiles%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Feuropean-grapevine-mothj-medium.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>You Think You Know Malbec Wine. You Are Wrong.</h1><p>First, a confession. I've long thought malbecs from Argentina vastly overrated, slack-jawed big reds found hanging out in bad steakhouses and touted as $15 retail bargains. So when a host of new, elite versions costing more than $100 a bottle recently came on the scene I didn't expect to be won over.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/547477e3e042416ca63e92b7ebba7996/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.bwbx.io%2Fimages%2Fusers%2FiqjWHBFdfxIU%2FiB4Yo_xH7wDo%2Fv0%2F-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why America is drunk on canned wine</h1><p>It's never too late to crack open a can of chardonnay. This summer, millions of wine-drinkers ditched corks and slipped a can of wine in to-go bags. Canned wine is a booming, if relatively new, sector of the wine business in the U.S., with Nielsen reporting a whopping 125.2% increase in sale of canned wine alone in the last year, with sales at $14.5 million, up from $6.4 million the previous year.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c0a7b7489a497fc0ae5c1c393e3ad5f9/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=600&cropwidth=944&degrees=0&input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gannett-cdn.com%2F-mm-%2F276246ae0012d93e838ced843119a2ffb565d4ba%2Fc%3D0-262-2850-1872%26r%3Dx633%26c%3D1200x630%2Flocal%2F-%2Fmedia%2F2016%2F08%2F17%2FUSATODAY%2FUSATODAY%2F636070419872390916-Underwood-Cans-front-hero.jpg&x=113&y=17"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Here's the best reason of all to drink organic wine: It tastes better.</h1><p>Do organic wines taste better than conventional wines? Conventional wisdom would say no. We may shop at Whole Foods Market or MOM's Organic Market, and we may pull over in traffic at the sight of a farmer with a load of tomatoes on a flatbed truck, but apparently we raise a skeptical eyebrow at the word "organic" on a wine label.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/88f4bece34238432103551acc8b51d8b/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.washingtonpost.com%2Frf%2Fimage_1484w%2F2010-2019%2FWashingtonPost%2F2015%2F03%2F12%2FFood%2FImages%2F2015-02-10T175236Z_01_DUV486_RTRIDSP_3_FRANCE-ALCOHOL-EXPORTS.jpg"></article>]]></description>
