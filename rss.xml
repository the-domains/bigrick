            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Two perspectives on Sauvignon Blanc from one winery</h1><p>If Sauvignon Blanc bears one criticism, it is the trite repetition of its prized features. Before even opening a bottle one anticipates brisk citrus highlights, a cool peach foundation and intriguing dabs of grass or tomatillo. Even modest bottles provide that sensation of clean, fresh fruit that most wine drinkers adore, particularly during the warmer months.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Things You Probably Don't Know About Napa | VinePair</h1><p>When it comes to learning about wine, it's the amount of minutiae that sucks out all the fun. Regions, subregions, crus, vineyards, producers, grapes - it can make our favorite beverage downright impossible to understand. In the grand scheme of things, the wines of the Napa Valley seem fairly straightforward; the region is all about rich, buttery Chardonnay and oaky, powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, right?</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0d4e999671cc87cc1c8d77ffa8e983c8/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fvinepair.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fnapa-valley-5-things-social.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Want to Drink All Day This Summer? These 10 Beers Are for You</h1><p>Broadly speaking, what beer fans call a "session beer" is one that should wield a low enough alcohol content that, if consumed in succession during one sit-down "session" of drinking, one doesn't get too inebriated. Now, the specific line of demarcation in alcohol by volume (ABV) that constitutes a session beer is subjective.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f4c1f62d2d86a396326512b26d77ad07/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.bwbx.io%2Fimages%2Fusers%2FiqjWHBFdfxIU%2FiIgAizvCas6s%2Fv0%2F-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Congress has prohibited American tourists from visiting what John F. Kennedy once called " that imprisoned island " since 1960, and the resumption of commercial air service won't soon change that.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0924926dd2e8a1b61f85f58c1fdd5319/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.bwbx.io%2Fimages%2Fusers%2FiqjWHBFdfxIU%2FiZnMNDIYN4u4%2Fv0%2F-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
