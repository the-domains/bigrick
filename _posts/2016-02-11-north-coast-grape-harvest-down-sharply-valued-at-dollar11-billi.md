description: 'The value of the North Coast grape crop fell 23 percent in 2015, resulting in the smallest return for growers since 2011, according to report released Wednesday. The local wine industry had expected a lighter crop given such factors as a longer bloom period last spring and the occurrence of shatter, when grape clusters have not fully developed.'
