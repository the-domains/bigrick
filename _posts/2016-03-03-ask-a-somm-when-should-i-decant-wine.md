description: "Back before the days of Roy Choi and Michael Voltaggio, Los Angeles was home to chefs like Wolfgang Puck, Nancy Silverton, and Josiah Citrin - the city's old guard. Perhaps retaining some of L.A.'s original DNA, those latter chefs have mostly stayed true to proper white tablecloth dining, a nearly extinct species among the city's influx of fermentation and bowls of raw fish."
