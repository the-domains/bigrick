description: "\"Inaccessible\" doesn't seem to have a place in K. Laz Wine Collection owner Kerrin Laz's vocabulary. With the debut of her posh tasting room in downtown Yountville this past fall, she's seeking to share the wealth, offering by-appointment, private sit-down samplings of treasures like the nearly impossible-to-find 2012 Screaming Eagle Second Flight ($635), and the forthcoming Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 (price TBD), expected to be released in March."
