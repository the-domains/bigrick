description: "Last weekend I orchestrated a culinary blitz of the Napa Valley, going to 11 restaurants for my upcoming Bay Area Top 100 Restaurants guide. It wouldn't be a surprise to say that there is lots of great food there, and I still appreciated much of it even after having multiple lunches and dinners on the same day."
