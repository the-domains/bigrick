description: "Here it is 2095, and I'm only now visiting the World's Greatest Wine Library. Its vastness is daunting, its resources unparalleled. On that shelf, the first wine book ever published. Printed by Gutenberg, it's the first edition of the Wine Bible. Inscribed by the author Karen MacNeil, who lived to be nearly 600 years old."
