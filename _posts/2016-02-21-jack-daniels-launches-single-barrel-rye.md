description: "Back in 2012, Jack Daniel's released a limited edition Unaged Rye Whiskey, their first new grain recipe since before Prohibition. Then in 2014, they released that same whiskey, except this time it had been aged in oak barrels for two years. That was the one-off, work-in-progress Rested Tennessee Rye."
