A special malbec vertical tasting starting with 2004 vintage at Hope and Grace in Yountville. This isn't the harsh $10 imported malbec! It was great! Snacks from Bouchon and it was a benefit for the Wine Country Animal Lovers a local non-profit that helps dogs and cats by providing shelter, food, medical attention and forever homes! It happens again Sunday from Noon to 3pm.
