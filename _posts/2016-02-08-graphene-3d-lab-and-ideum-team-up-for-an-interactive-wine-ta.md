Wow this is cool! "Jean-Charles Boisset, JCB Wines in Yountville, California has developed the JCB Wine Tasting Experience, which involves smart technology, 3D printed wine glasses, and some very sophisticated software. The experience takes place in the new JCB Tasting Salon, which features smart tables that seat four people each. Visitors are served five different wines over the course of the tasting, which lasts for 40 minutes to an hour."
