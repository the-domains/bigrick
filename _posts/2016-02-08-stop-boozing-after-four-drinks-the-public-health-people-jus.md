description: "Nothing better sums up the out-of-touchness of public health prigs than the debate about so-called binge drinking. To these teetotal, ciggie-dodging suits, for whom fun is the foulest of f-words, and who are such miserabilists that they're made sad by the idea of happy hour, anything more than four units of booze a day for a bloke, and three for a lady, counts as binging."
