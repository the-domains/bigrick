  Finally, the Napa Valley Wine Train offers an experience that can not only
  compete with the wine country bus tours, but also offer a more sophisticated,
  intimate and complete Napa Valley adventure. The new Quattro Vino tour
  launched on June 1 and features four stops for tastings and tours at some of
  Napa Valley's most historically significant wineries: Robert Mondavi Winery,
  Charles Krug Winery, Merryvale Vineyards and V.
