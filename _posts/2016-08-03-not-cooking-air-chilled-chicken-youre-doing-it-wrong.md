  For Ariane Daguin, the daughter of French restaurateursand founder of high-end
  meat purveyor D'Artagnan, her first bites of American chicken were nothing
  short of terrible. "I didn't understand," she says, the memory of disgust
  still audible in her voice decades later. "It tasted like fish sometimes.
  Other times it was tasteless."
