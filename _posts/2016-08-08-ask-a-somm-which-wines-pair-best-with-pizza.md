  Considered one of San Francisco's essential restaurants, Tony's Pizza
  Napoletana is a multi-faceted pizza operation that fires up myriad of pie
  styles, from Detroit to Sicilian to coal-fired. With its wide range of pizzas
  and toppings, wine director Juli Gregg pairs mostly Italian and
  California-sourced juice, much of which is based on the tomato-friendly
  sangiovese grape.
