  For those hungry for celebrity sightings, this year's Auction Napa Valley was
  the place to be: Early Friday, there was actress Courteney Cox rushing past
  all the stalls offering top-flight vintages to get to her favorite, Silver Oak
  (the vineyard's lot "Dinner with Friends," featuring a wine-paired supper with
  Cox, went for $170,000 the next day); and late Saturday night, you could spot
  Kate Upton breaking it down on the dance floor to a 30-piece Cuban band.
