  Profound changes are being considered for Napa Valley Expo, including the
  razing of a half dozen buildings to make room for new, more flexible
  structures. But first, the Expo needs better grass. That was the upshot of

  three development scenarios and Latitude 38, the promoter of the BottleRock
  music festival, said the need for improved lawn was urgent.
