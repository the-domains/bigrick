description: 'Vintage Notes: A warm, dry spring brought early bud break, helped with canopy vigor and berry size. The conditions were ideal for flowering and fruit set under sunny skies. With the exception of one heat spike in late June/early July, temperatures were consistently in the zone for optimal vine activity, resulting in notably healthy vines as fruit went through veraison and started ripening.'
