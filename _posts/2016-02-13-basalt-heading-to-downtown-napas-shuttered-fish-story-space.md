description: "With restaurants like Redd, Redd Wood and Molina in their collection, Moana Restaurant Group is no stranger to the Wine Country food scene. Now they're converting the former Fish Story space in downtown Napa for a new restaurant called Basalt. Basalt will feature a seasonal California menu, which will be peppered with the flavors of Spain, Mexico and Portugal."
