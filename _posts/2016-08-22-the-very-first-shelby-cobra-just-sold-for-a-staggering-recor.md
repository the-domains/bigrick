  The Monterey Car Week auctions are where the beautiful members of the landed
  gentry go to blow obscene amounts of money on cars, and at yesterday's RM
  Sotheby's auction, one of them took Cobramania to new heights. This 1962
  Shelby 260 Cobra known as the CSX 2000 just commanded $13.75 million at
  auction.
