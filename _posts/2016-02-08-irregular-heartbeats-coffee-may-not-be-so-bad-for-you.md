description: 'People with irregular heartbeats are often advised to give up caffeine, but a new study suggests they may not have to forgo their coffee. Researchers had 1,388 people record their intake of coffee, tea and chocolate over a one-year period, and used Holter monitors to get 24-hour electrocardiograms. More than 60 percent of the participants reported consuming one or more caffeine-containing foods daily.'
