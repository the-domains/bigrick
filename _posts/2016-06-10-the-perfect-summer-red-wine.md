  Ruby-tinged and light-bodied, American gamay noir is a red that's as
  refreshing as most rosés but more broadly satisfying and lively. Its fruity
  character and high acidity make it great for pairing with grilled meats and
  veggies. And like rosé, it benefits from a slight chill-about half an hour in
  the fridge or ice bucket.
