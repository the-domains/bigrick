description: "The Wines of Mount Veeder Tasting: April 21, San Francisco. Many people have visited Napa Valley, in some cases many times, without setting food on some of its most interesting terroir. That's because the steep and remote hillsides of Napa's mountain AVAs tend to be sparsely populated and accessible only by carsick-inducing roads that most tour buses, limos, and unadventurous tourists can't manage."
