  Our second day in Paso Robles was billed as a "vineyard to glass" experience.
  We started with our chariot bus from Breakaway Tours where Owner Jill Tweedie
  helped start our journey in style. We arrived at the train-themed Pomar
  Junction Vineyard & Winery, where Matt Merrill, the general manager, and Jim
  Shumate, the winemaker, greeted us with a tour.
