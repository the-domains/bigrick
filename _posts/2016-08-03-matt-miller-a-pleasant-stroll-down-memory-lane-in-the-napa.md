  The Napa Valley I grew up in was far different than the one I visited last
  weekend. There was more open space between the wineries that dot the famed
  landscape along Highway 29 to Calistoga. Now there are entrepreneurs along the
  entire route - and Silverado Trail for that matter - extolling the virtues of
  their Merlots, Zinfandels and Cabernet Sauvignons.
