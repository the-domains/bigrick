description: "PINNING OUR HOPES: There are always a few wishes in our hearts before we make for a major, multi-day music festival. We hope that we can find lodging nearby, and it won't be too spendy. We hope that our favorite band, the one we're really looking forward to seeing, plays the group's best deep cut."
