  First, a confession. I've long thought malbecs from Argentina vastly
  overrated, slack-jawed big reds found hanging out in bad steakhouses and
  touted as $15 retail bargains. So when a host of new, elite versions costing
  more than $100 a bottle recently came on the scene I didn't expect to be won
  over.
