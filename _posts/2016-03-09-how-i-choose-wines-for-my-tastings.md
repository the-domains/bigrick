description: "As you may know if you read me regularly, I've been having some wonderful wine tastings with my friends at Jackson Family Wines. Over the last 1-1/2 years we've done multiple sessions of mainly California wines: Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Rhone blends and so on. Our next theme is sparkling wine."
