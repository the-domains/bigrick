**_[A blind tasting of Mt. Veeder][0]_**

Steve Heimoff

"...this Veeder tasting was a sensation. And why not? Mt. Veeder is one of Napa's greatest appellations. It's a cooler place, the southernmost of Napa's western mountains, and benefits from a Carneros influence, although as you go from the cooler southern aspect to the more northerly aspect on the mountain, the climate warms up."
