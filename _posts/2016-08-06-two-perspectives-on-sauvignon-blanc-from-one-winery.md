  If Sauvignon Blanc bears one criticism, it is the trite repetition of its
  prized features. Before even opening a bottle one anticipates brisk citrus
  highlights, a cool peach foundation and intriguing dabs of grass or tomatillo.
  Even modest bottles provide that sensation of clean, fresh fruit that most
  wine drinkers adore, particularly during the warmer months.
