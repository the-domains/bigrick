description: "Polenta is akin to Southern grits, so even though it's Italian in origin, it resonates with Americans as stick-to-your ribs comfort food. Its thick, creamy, starchiness is perfect as a bed for rich braises and stews, or garnished with a sauce or vegetables that play off its nutty, minerally notes, polenta itself can the basis for a substantial meal."
