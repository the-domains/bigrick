  Fergus entered Daphne's restaurant, an Italian restaurant in London's tony
  South Kensington neighborhood that's a favorite of celebrities and serves a
  gorgeous Tagliatelle with Girolles and Summer Truffle for £30 ($39). He sat
  down, drank a little water and looked around the room. Sniffed the air. Licked
  his nose.
