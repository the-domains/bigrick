  Zinfandel has long been one of America's favorite varieties, prized for its
  fruity berry flavors and spicy notes of pepper, licorice and vanilla. It's a
  lot of people's favorite match with barbecue, making it great for savoring in
  the summer. It also doesn't hurt that Zinfandel provides fistfuls of flavor
  and intrigue for $50 and under.
