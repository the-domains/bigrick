  Few things are as quintessentially summery as watermelon: Swollen to perfect
  ripeness in July and August, crisp, juicy, and cool to the tongue, it makes
  for an unbeatable post-beach snack or a lawn-chair dessert. Yet watermelon's
  place in the cocktail canon is almost nonexistent; when it does appear, it
  tends to be in the undesirable form of a flavored vodka.
