description: "The standard winery tasting bar is so 2012. In Napa and Sonoma, the term tasting room is out -- and \"hospitality house\" is in. Instead of bellying up to the bar, you relax in intimate living rooms and wine lounges, served by a \"wine educator,\" in lieu of a \"pourer.\" And you don't winery hop, you relax and stay a while. Here's just a sampling of new winery tasting experiences."
