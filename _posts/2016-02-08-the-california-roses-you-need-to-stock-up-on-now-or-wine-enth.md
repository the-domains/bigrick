description: "By all accounts, the 2015 vintage in Northern California was exceptional, but what it wasn't? Abundant. It produced nowhere near what 2012 and 2013 did. And 2014 was a triple streak of quality and quantity in California wine. The good news? We still have plenty of great wine to look forward to."
