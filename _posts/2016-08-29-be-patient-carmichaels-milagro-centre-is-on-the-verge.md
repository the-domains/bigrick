  For the past two years, anxious foodies have been asking the question: When is
  the Milagro Centre going to open? Milagro is the upscale, 46,000-square-foot
  soon-to-be destination that will offer a variety of restaurants (two are now
  serving), a 7,000-square-foot events center, and a giant patio (with
  Godzilla-size fireplace) for communal sipping and supping.
