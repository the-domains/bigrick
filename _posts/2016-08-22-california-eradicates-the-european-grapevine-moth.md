  In what's being heralded a "success story," California is officially
  eradicated of the European grapevine moth (EGVM). The good news means the
  lifting of quarantine restrictions in several grape-growing regions throughout
  the state. The EGVM was first detected in a Napa County Chardonnay vineyard in
  2009, the first time ever the pest was discovered in North America.
