  Last week I was sipping the latest vintage of cult Italian red Ornellaia in a
  light-filled downtown loft with bearded winemaker Axel Heinz.He gives a name
  to each year's cuvée-the 2014 is L'Essenza, the essence-and when this ripe,
  chocolatey cabernet and merlot blend makes its debut a couple of months from
  now at a golden price tag of $240 a bottle, it will sell out to collectors.
