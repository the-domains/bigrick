description: "Peter Mondavi, a pioneer of the Napa Valley wine industry, died over the weekend in California. He was 101. Mondavi and his more famous brother, Robert, joined their parents' business, the Charles Krug Winery, in 1943. Back then, the Napa Valley was better known for producing prunes and its grapes were grown for cheap jug wine."
