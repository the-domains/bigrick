      When the 2011 earthquake and tsunami struck Tohoku, Japan, Chris
      Goldfinger was two hundred miles away, in the city of Kashiwa, at an
      international meeting on seismology. As the shaking started, everyone in
      the room began to laugh. Earthquakes are common in Japan-that one was the
      third of the week-and the participants were, after all, at a seismology
      conference.

  As the second anniversary of the August 24, 2014 South Napa earthquake
  approaches, U.S. Geological Survey scientists and volunteers, along with
  faculty and students from California State University, East Bay are planning
  an experiment to visualize the subsurface in and around the City of Napa and
  measure how the ground responds to earthquake shaking in different
  neighborhoods.
