  It's never too late to crack open a can of chardonnay. This summer, millions
  of wine-drinkers ditched corks and slipped a can of wine in to-go bags. Canned
  wine is a booming, if relatively new, sector of the wine business in the U.S.,
  with Nielsen reporting a whopping 125.2% increase in sale of canned wine alone
  in the last year, with sales at $14.5 million, up from $6.4 million the
  previous year.
