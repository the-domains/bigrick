  Fifty years ago this month, the landscape of Napa Valley changed when Robert
  Mondavi opened his winery along California Route 29 in Oakville. The winery's
  Mission-style archway quickly became an iconic symbol of California wine, and
  Mondavi and those who worked with him forged a revolution not only in Napa but
  also across the country, transforming the way Americans buy and drink wine.
