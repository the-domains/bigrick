  I came to the United States when I was 14 years old with the dream of pursuing
  my education. I came alone, and therefore also with the responsibility of
  supporting myself. I am one of many who, following a dream, found myself
  following the crops and harvest seasons from Arizona to California, Oregon and
  sometimes even to Washington.
