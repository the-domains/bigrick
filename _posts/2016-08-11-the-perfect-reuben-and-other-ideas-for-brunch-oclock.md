  Duck & Waffle is a pioneer of 24-hour dining in London. Several times, I have
  wandered in at 5 a.m., seeking comfort in a Bloody Mary and Colombian eggs. At
  that time, the restaurant is relatively quiet. For much of the day and night
  it is packed and buzzy, and much of the credit for that goes to chef Dan
  Doherty, 32.
