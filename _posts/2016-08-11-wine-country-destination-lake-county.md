  Have you been wine tasting in Lake County recently? The first vineyards here
  were planted back in the 1870's and today the County has over 30 wineries.
  Many of the area's winegrowers are generational farmers whose families grew
  other crops (such as pears and walnuts) before planting vineyards.
