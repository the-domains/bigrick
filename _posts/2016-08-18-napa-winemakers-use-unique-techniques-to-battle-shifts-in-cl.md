      There's an unbreachable divide between advocates of modern conventional
      agriculture and, essentially, everyone else, from the mainstream (organic,
      local, anti-GMO) to the less-so (biodynamics, permaculture, agroforestry).
      The parties are entrenched, the tone is partisan. But I think we ought to
      be able to get along, because all hard-core advocates of this or that food
      philosophy have two things in common: They're paying attention, and
      they're wrong.
