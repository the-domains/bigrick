description: 'Ideum has collaborated with JCB Wines to create an entirely new wine tasting experience for their Yountville, California tasting lounge. Guests gather around a custom Ideum Platform 55 multitouch table with a gold top and black crocodile-skin base. Then they are guided through a 45-minute tasting experience in which they can explore the inspiration for and information about the wines they taste.'
