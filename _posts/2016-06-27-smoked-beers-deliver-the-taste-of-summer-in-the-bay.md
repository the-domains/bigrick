      It's not easy to live in the shadow of one of the craft beer capitals of
      America. Asheville, N.C. is widely recognized as one of the hotspots of
      craft - arguably the hotspot in the Southeast. But 128 miles to the east,
      the state's business hub and biggest city is starting to build a
      reputation of its own.

  While many people at the recent Sierra Nevada Beer Camp stop at San
  Francisco's Pier 35 were standing in line for a few sips of Russian River's
  excellent 2013 Beatification magnum (which was actually poured by owners
  Vinnie and Natalie Cilurzo), I found myself seeking out smoky beers.
