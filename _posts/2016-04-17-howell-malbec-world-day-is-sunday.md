Yippee. That's all I need for an excuse to uncork one of the world's most popular reds. This date was not chosen at random.</p><img src="http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7d5aa0e66d54040f7923296913c768b87c6d926e/c=0-328-1918-1412&amp;r=x633&amp;c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Rochester/Rochester/635960641278594953-1394121741000-ARG-10-bodega-Salenstein.jpg" /></article>
