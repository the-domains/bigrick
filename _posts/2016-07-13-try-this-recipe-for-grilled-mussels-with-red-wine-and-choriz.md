  Instead of steaming mussels, try throwing them on the grill. This recipe, from
  Hurley's Restaurant in Yountville, Calif. calls for heating the mussels in a
  basket over a hot grill, which lends light smoky notes to the shellfish.
  They're then tossed with a flavorful blend of chorizo, a rich wine reduction,
  tomatoes, parsley and butter.
