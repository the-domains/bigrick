  Straight, round or crooknecked, summer squash shapes our warm-weather meals.
  Abundant from June through September, these thin-skinned staples can be turned
  into an incredible variety of dishes, both savory and sweet. Absorbing other
  flavors into its mild flesh, summer squash becomes a mealtime chameleon,
  subbing for pasta in lasagna or fat in baked goods.
