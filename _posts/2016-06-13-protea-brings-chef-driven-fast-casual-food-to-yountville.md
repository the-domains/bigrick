  Yountville is known for some of the valley's finest dining (The French
  Laundry, Redd), but until now, there had not been a chef-driven fast casual
  option for locals and those on the go between tastings. To fill that space,
  chef Anita Cartagena (formerly at Ciccio) has opened Protea with a
  daily-changing menu of Latin food, with every dish mainly under $15.
