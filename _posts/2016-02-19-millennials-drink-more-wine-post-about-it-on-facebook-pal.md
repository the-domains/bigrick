description: "Don't think that presidential politics is the only game of \"who do you love?\" now being played out. Just as pollsters have been surveying voter preferences in places as diverse as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, researchers hired by the Wine Market Council (WMC) have been surveying adult Americans about whether they drink wine, how much wine they drink if they do and what kind of wine will they purchase when they go into a wine store or restaurant."
