description: "The curtains will close on PBS's beloved British soap opera Downton Abbey on March 6, and if you're longtime fans like us, you'll need a drink in order to cope. Throughout the lavishly costumed series, which chronicles 14 years of upper-crust intrigue on an aristocratic English estate, drinks have played a central role-so much that a Downton Abbey-inspired wine collection was released in 2013 and expanded last year."
