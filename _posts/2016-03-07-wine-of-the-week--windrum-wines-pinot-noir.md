description: "Mark Oliver, a partner of Windrum Wine , located in Santa Barbara County, emailed to ask if I'd like to taste his Pinot Noirs. As his company is a négociant wine brand, there's a lot of freedom to choose wine grapes that are grown in the finest vineyards, which makes the most sense to some."
