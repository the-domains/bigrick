[Cycle for Sight][0] has three scenic 50, 25, and 15 mile courses, that wind among the hills and vineyards of the World Famous Napa Valley. The ride starts and finishes at Justin Siena High School where the Cycle for Sight Wine and Music Festival will take place.

During the festival enjoy wine tasting from Napa Valley wineries, beer tasting from local microbreweries and local cuisine from Napa Valley restaurants, all while listening and dancing to the sounds of "Pride and Joy".

Proceeds will go to two local organizations, Enchanted Hills Camp For The Blind & Visually Impaired and The California Veterans "Pathway Home Project." Our goal is to raise $100,000\.
