description: "Tempranillo is Spain's second most planted grape, after the the lesser-known airén, and it is the country's signature varietal wine-one that's a crowd-pleaser, yet also age-worthy and collectable. According to Australian economics professor Kym Anderson, global Tempranillo plantings have boomed, increasing almost fivefold between 1990 and 2010, bringing tempranillo from the world's 24th most planted grape to the fourth."
